1 Installation
**************

Here is a guide to installing the Lispbot on your system.

It assumes that you have some basic knowledge of your LISP environment.

1.1 Download
============

As there is no released version of Lispbot yet, you have to get it from
git. This has the advantage, that you can stay up to date easily.

To download the master branch of the lispbot type:

     git clone git://gitorious.org/lispbot/lispbot.git

You can than get the latest changes by `cd''ing into the lispbot
directory and typing:

     git pull

1.2 Dependencies
================

Lispbot depends on the following external libraries:

   * cl-ppcre (http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre)

   * cl-irc (http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-irc)

   * split-sequence (http://www.cliki.net/SPLIT-SEQUENCE)

   * alexandria (http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/)

Please note that currently there seems to be some incompatibility
between cl-irc and its dependency flexi-streams. If you get an error
about a symbol from flexi-streams not being found, please use the SVN
version of cl-irc.

1.3 ASDF
========

If you want to use ASDF to load the lispbot, create symbolic links from
the .asd files in the root and plugin directories to a place where asdf
looks for system definition files. For example `~/.sbcl/systems'.

If you use a lisp implementation that doesn't bundle asdf, you probably
have to load the asdf.lisp file from somewhere.

When asdf is loaded and all the dependencies are installed, you should
be able to load/compile the lispbot with:

     (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'lispbot)
     (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'lispbot-plugins)

1.4 Non ASDF
============

It is also possible, though not recommended, to just load all the .lisp
files without asdf.
