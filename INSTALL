INSTALLATON
===========

DEPENDENCIES
------------

 * cl-ppcre (http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre)
 * cl-irc (http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-irc)
 * split-sequence (http://www.cliki.net/SPLIT-SEQUENCE)

Please note, that currently there seems to be some incompatibility between
cl-irc and its dependency flexi-streams. If you get an error about some symbol
from flexi streams not being found, please use the SVN version of cl-irc.

ASDF
----

If you want to use ASDF to load the lispbot, create symbolic links from the .asd
files in the root and plugin directorys to a place where asdf looks for system
definition files. For example ~/.sbcl/systems.

If you use a lisp implementaton that doesn't bundle asdf, you probably have to
load the asdf.lisp file from somewhere.

When asdf is loaded you should be able to load/compile the lispbot with:

	(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'lispbot)
	(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'lispbot-plugins)

NON ASDF
--------

It is also possible, though not recommended, to just load all the .lisp files
without asdf.



For usage of the lispbot see the README file.
